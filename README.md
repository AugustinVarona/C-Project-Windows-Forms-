# C-Project-Windows-Forms-

I chose to do this project out of a desire to implement object-oriented and visual programming technologies (C#) in a project that would present the design of an application with a collection of games.

Making a visual application is not just about drawing and arranging controls, but mainly about making architectural decisions based on one of the basic architectural models.
